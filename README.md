*Plagiarism Detector*

This is a simple plagiarism detector which takes in two text files and checks for similarities between the two files. The program will output a similarity score as a percentage, indicating how similar the two files are.

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Usage
To use the plagiarism detector, navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal and run the following command:

python plagiarism_detector.py file1.txt file2.txt

Replace file1.txt and file2.txt with the names of the files you want to compare.

Output

The program will output a similarity score as a percentage, indicating how similar the two files are. If the similarity score is high, it may indicate that one file has been plagiarized from the other.
